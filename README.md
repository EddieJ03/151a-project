# 151A Project

## Introduction
We decided to pursue this project for its real-world relevance in addressing the challenge of predicting user ratings from textual reviews. For this project, we decided to focus on the [Amazon Digital_Music](https://amazon-reviews-2023.github.io/) dataset. This topic touches on the intersection of sentiment analysis, focusing on how user-generated content can reveal customer satisfaction. The dataset's inherent challenges, such as class imbalance, make it an interesting and valuable task for machine learning practitioners, while its application in the digital music domain aligns with practical and impactful use cases like personalized recommendations.

We thought this project to be exciting because it shows the power of machine learning techniques to interpret natural language and deliver meaningful insights. A good predictive model in this context can have the following implications: it can enhance customer satisfaction, improve platform loyalty, and support better business strategies by understanding user needs. It also enables user to discover music they love more efficiently.
