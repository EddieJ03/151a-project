When the salesgirl handed me the CD, I was pleased to see that it actually included thirty pop songs by the likes of Lady Gaga, Usher, La Roux, Katy Perry, Black-Eyed Peas, Ke$ha, etc. I researched more after I got home, and discovered that this Japanese label (Manhattan Records) exists solely to put out rerecorded and remixed dance CDs based on recent pop hits, the key word being rerecorded. I guessed as much as I was listening to the CD in-store; several of the soundalikes do a great job, others are just so-so. It\\'s great for workouts, though, since the tracks fade one into another with no downtime (the bad side is that if you\\'ve got in in shuffle, the beginning of the next song, which is often in a different key, is kind of an awkward fade-out when not played in sequence).',\n",
